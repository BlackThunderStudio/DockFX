## About
This library was created to fill the void for docking frameworks available in the JavaFX RIA platform. Its intention is to provide you with a fully featured docking library. This project and its source code is licensed under the [GNU General Public License version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) and you should feel free to make adaptations of this work.

DockFX has a number of features:
* Full documentation
* Gratis and open source
* CSS and styling support

Features to be added in a to be determined future version:
* FXML support
* Scene builder integration
* DockBar support for floating toolbars
* Tab pane stacking of dock nodes with draggable headers
* A light docking library using no detachable windows

## Using the Library
You can download a prebuilt jar from the releases page where you will also find a prebuilt jar of the latest demo. You can simply download the library and include it in the class path of your project.

## Compiling from Source
The project was written in the Eclipse IDE. Included is a jar description for building the library which should work out of the box. A jar description is also included for building the demo jar but because of Eclipse's working directory it needs to be executed from the native file browser or command line which can be achieved by right clicking the exported jar and selecting the "Show In->System Explorer" option. Both of the jars should output to the root project directory.

## Contributing
Adaptations of the project are welcome but you are encouraged to send fixes upstream to the master repository. I use the [Google Java style conventions](https://github.com/google/styleguide) which you can download an Eclipse plugin for. After importing the Eclipse formatter you can use CTRL+SHIFT+F to run the formatter on your code. It is requested that commits sent to this repository follow these conventions. Please see the following [link](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Metanome/wiki/Installing-the-google-styleguide-settings-in-intellij-and-eclipse) for instructions on configuring the Google style conventions with the Eclipse or IntelliJ IDE.
